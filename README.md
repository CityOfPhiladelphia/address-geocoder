# address-geocoder
A tool to standardize and geocode Philadelphia addresses

## 1. Setup
You will need the following things:
1. An addresses file, provided to you by CityGeo. 
2. An AIS API key, provided to you by CityGeo.
3. Python installed on your computer, at least version 3.9

To download, use git:
```
git clone git@github.com:CityOfPhiladelphia/address-geocoder.git
```
If you have not set up authentication with git on your machine before, reference this [guidance on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent).

Alternatively, you can download the repository as a zip file using GitHub's web interface.

Next, navigate to the project's directory and create a virtual environment:
```
python3 -m venv venv
```

Then, activate the virtual environment. This will need to be activated
every time you want to run the append tool, not just this once:
```
source venv/bin/activate
```

Finally, install the packages in requirements.text:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Once you have installed everything, it is time to fill in the config file.

## 2. How to Use Address Geocoder
Address Geocoder takes an input file containing addresses 
and appends latitude and longitude to those addresses, as well as any optional
fields that the user supplies.

In order to run `Address Geocoder`, first set up the configuration file. By default,
`Address Geocoder` searchers for a file named `config.yml`. This is the recommended config filename. You can copy the template in
`config_example.yml` to a file named `config.yml` and continue from there. Detailed steps for filling out the config file are in the next section.

Then, run:

```
python3 geocoder.py
```

The dialogue will ask you to specify a config file. Hit enter without typing anything to
keep the default config file ('./config.yml')

### Configuration
1. Copy `config_example.yml` to `config.yml` by running in the terminal:
```
cp config_example.yml config.yml
```
2. Add your AIS API Key here:

```
AIS_API_KEY:
```
3. Add the filepath for the input file (the file that you wish to append to), and the geography file (the address file you have been given.) This should look something like this:
```
input_file: ./data/example_input_4.csv
geography_file: ./data/addresses.parquet
```
4. Map the address fields to the name of the fields in the csv that you wish
to process. If you have one combined address field, map it to full_address_field.
Otherwise, leave full_address_field blank and map column names to street, city, state, and zip. Street must be included,
while the others are optional.

Example, for a csv with the following fields:
`addr_st, addr_city, addr_zip`

```
input_file: 'example.csv'

full_address_field:

address_fields:
  street: addr_st
  city: addr_city
  state:
  zip: addr_zip
```
5. List which fields other than latitude and longitude you want to append.
(Latitude and longitude will always be appended.) If you enter an invalid field, the program will error out and ask you to try again.
A complete list of valid fields can be found further down in this README. 

```
append_fields:
  - census_tract_2020
  - census_block_group_2020
  - census_block_2020
```

The full config file should look something like this:
```
# Connection Credentials
AIS_API_KEY: YOUR_API_KEY

# File Config
input_file: ./data/example_input_4.csv
geography_file: ./data/addresses.parquet

full_address_field: address

# OR, IF ADDRESS IS SPLIT INTO MULTIPLE COLUMNS:
address_fields:
  street:
  city:
  state:
  zip:

# Append Fields -- Aside from coordinates, what fields to append
append_fields:
  - census_tract_2020
  - census_block_group_2020
  - census_block_2020
```

6. You're now ready to run the geocoder:

```
python3 geocoder.py
```

The dialogue will ask you to specify a config file. Hit enter without typing anything to
keep the default config file ('./config.yml')

The output file will be saved in the same location as your input file, with _appended attached to the filename.

## How The Geocoder Works
`Address-Geocoder` processes a csv file with addresses, and geolocates those
addresses using the following steps:

1. Takes an input file of addresses, and standardizes those 
addresses using `passyunk`, Philadelphia's address standardization system.
2. Compares the standardized data to a local parquet file, `addresses.parquet`,
and appends the user-specified fields as well as latitude and longitude from that file
3. Not all records will match to the address file. For those records that do not match,
`Address-Geocoder` queries the Address Information System (AIS) API and appends returned fields.
Please note that this process can take some time, so processing large files with a messy address field
is not recommended. As an example, if you have a file that needs 1,000 rows to be sent to AIS, this will take
approximately 3-4 minutes.
5. The appended file is then saved to the same directory as the input file.

## Testing
This package uses the pytest module to conduct unit tests. Tests are
located in the `tests/` folder.

In order to run all tests, for example:
```
python3 pytest tests/
```

To run tests from one file:
```
python3 pytest tests/test_parser.py
```

To run one test within a file:
```
python3 pytest tests/test_parser.py::test_parse_address
```
